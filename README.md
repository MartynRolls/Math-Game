## Math Gaame with Pythons Pygame

When the New York Times was testing its new game, Connections, it was also testing out another game called Digits.
In this game, you were givin 6 numbers and a goal, and had to reach it by combining numbers with the 4 operators, like countdown.

Originally, I was just goin to make a clone of digits, so that I could play it all I want, but I came up with my own thing.

In this game, your given a list of operators, and you have to place the numbers in the correct order to move on to the more difficult levels.
You can't use a number more than once, and you only need to use as many numbers as there are spaces(?).

I started making it more polished, but when you move on tot he next level, it's sudden, but I started working on other projects so I decided to put this one under the bed.
